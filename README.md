UI Idea & Improvement
UI plays a vital role because it can turn potential visitors into buyers as it facilitates interactions between the user and your web application.

As a full-stack developer, I can develop a better UI for saveo. For this, I created a demo mobile-based UI. Here is a side-by-side comparison.
                                   

  You can see a live demo of this UI on this link - https://nalindev.github.io/saveo/

I prefer to use tailwind css framework because it automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be. In fact, most Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client.
                                                                   

Api Fetch & Loader Improvement - 

When Users visit on saveo.in then they will have to wait for several seconds until the saveo web app fetches the data from API. This will really give a bad experience to users.
Also no loaders are being displayed during the load time.
                                               
To increase user experience my idea is to use skeleton loader so that users can interact more better with the site.

    What we can do to increase API fetch time in backend?
We can use concurrent/parallel API req when the url/route is being called instead of doing one by one.




New UI Features that is needed to add -

Increase Site Fast Loading Time
Loading time also need to be improved so that users can access site on any internet speed(2g, 3g, 4g). 

Optimisation also increases the chance of better search engine ranking.

Main issue of current saveo web app:

Unnecessary use of fontawesome icon package.
unused css style tag.
Font file is not optimised
Render blocking resources

The description of the issues is as follows:

We dont need to actually use whole package of fontawesome we can simply use the xml code of particular icon that we wan’t.
There is no need to include unnecessary css style tag in project if it is not being used. 
There are many font file which are not being used. 
Some css code prevents the page to load faster that we need to remove.

All the above points increase the load time on users devices by increasing the data size and by blocking the resources.

Route Improvement needed 

We also need to add a dynamic route for each product so that it can be accessed from google if users searches about the particular product.

                   <Route path="/:product">
            <Home />
          </Route>


Ex - if you search buy bag on google than you will get several results of amazon, flipkart product url through which users can easily place the order and read about it.






Login page Improvement

Login/authentication page need to be removed from first landing page. We only need to show Login ui when users want to place an order.

Because the first priority is to show the products to user and then if he is interested then we need to show the authentication page.

Ex- many sites like amazon, snapdeal, flipkart are doing the same thing.





Search Engine Optimisation
 
I am also skilled in SEO and i found a lots of issues on your web application.

SEO improves the size visibility on google so that new users can browse your site.

 Main issue of current saveo SEO:
 XML File not found
Missing prober sharing meta tag
HTML tag is not optimised according to seo rule
Site loads slower due to unused css, unnecessary use of font icon package, rendering issues.
No robots.txt file
Keyword not researched according to volume.
Uneven distribution of target keyword.
Very low inbound and outbound link.
Product route not available.
 No schema markup found
Main domain is not used 
0 backlink

                                      

      According to GTMatrix your load time is so slow which give bad experience to users.



Develop control panel

We also need to develop a control panel so that administrator can update and execute various rule by using user interface.



Main Domain
Product page must be on a main domain rather using the subdomain all the second level information should in a subdomain. 

Also the main domain have greater value to search engine & users rather than the subdomain.
The main domain also rank faster than the subdomain url.




How to Improve all above issues
A startup like you always try to hire those people who can increase there company value and i assure you that i will try my best to develop this site to its own unique kind.

I can fix all the above issues and also add new features.


I developed my demo saveo website in less than 2 days but i can develop much more better than this if you hire me as a full stack developer
