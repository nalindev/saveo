# Saveo research app
Introduction & Background

I am a 4th-year student from the Chandigarh group of college and I performed a deep research on your web application to find ways to improve your website performance, security, UI, and better search engine visibility.  



The objective of this Request for Proposal is to locate & solve a problem that will provide the best overall value to saveo.


I believe in doing not saying and that’s why I developed a mobile web application to give you a rough idea of how I can improve saveo.


UI Idea & Improvement
UI plays a vital role because it can turn potential visitors into buyers as it facilitates interactions between the user and your web application.


As a full-stack developer, I can develop a better UI for saveo. For this, I created a demo mobile-based UI. Here is a side-by-side comparison.
                                   


  You can see a live demo of this UI on this link - https://nalindev.github.io/saveo/ 

(deployed on Github)

NOTE - The above link can only be accessed through mobile devices because I didn’t develop a UI for the laptop devices yet.



I prefer to use tailwind css framework because it automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production, which means your final CSS bundle is the smallest it could possibly be. In fact, most Tailwind projects ship less than 10kB of CSS to the client.

                                                                   


Api Fetch & Loader Improvement -


When Users visit on saveo.in then they will have to wait for several seconds until the saveo web app fetches the data from API. This will really give a bad experience to users.
Also no loaders are being displayed during the load time.
                                               

To increase user experience my idea is to use skeleton loader so that users can interact more better with the site.

    What we can do to increase API fetch time in backend?

We can use concurrent/parallel API req when the url/route is being called instead of doing one by one.
